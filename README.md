# SnekChat

# This is a marvelous online chat, based on Python sockets. Simple as a brick.

#Things, that are needed to be done:
# Morichill:
#   - look up how to output into the console while the input is active
#   - think what functionality the user CLASS will need (considering we will make a bot out of it)
#   - think of the way to determite (SERVERSIDE) which message are displayed to which users (f.e. whisper,
#       server/bot messages to individual users, etc.)
